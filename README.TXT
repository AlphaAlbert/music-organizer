create a Music Organizer object to test Audio files can be located
Please do NOT include the mp3 files in your submission (don't change the .gitignore)
Objective

To modify an existing code base to support a additional functionality
To learn to use branches in github to manage different source code goals under a single folder
IF so desired, to examine how media files can be loaded by imported objects

Code Responsibilities

Complete The following two exercises with the music Organizer - (p 164)
4.43 - play a random track (think of this is as the shake your iPod feature to get a random track)
4.45 - write a method to randomly play every track in a list exactly once (a non repeat shuffle feature)
(Look at the Random object in the API docs to find a method to give you a random number)
